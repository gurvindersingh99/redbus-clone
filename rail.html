                        and destination locations along with the date of travel. Once done, a list of trains operating
                        on your route will be displayed. Select the train and class of your choice, select the boarding
                        and destination stations, enter the details of the passenger and complete the payment. You can
                        download the ticket and the invoice once your payment has been processed.</p>
